# 16 — Drift Detection

Automatic configuration change tracking between Ansible runs. Captures host
fact snapshots, compares them to detect drift, and alerts when thresholds
are exceeded.

---

## Architecture

```
Job completes (fact cache enabled)
         │
         ▼
  finish_fact_cache()          ── updates host.ansible_facts
         │
         ▼
  capture_fact_snapshot        ── Celery task (async)
         │                        computes SHA-256 hash of facts
         │                        skips if hash matches previous snapshot
         ▼
  HostFactSnapshot created     ── full ansible_facts stored
         │
         ▼
  detect_drift                 ── Celery task (async)
         │                        compares with previous snapshot
         │                        categorizes changes (packages, kernel, ...)
         │                        assigns severity (low → critical)
         ▼
  DriftDetection records       ── one per changed fact key
         │
         ▼
  evaluate_drift_alerts        ── Celery task (async)
         │                        checks all enabled DriftAlertRules
         │                        threshold, window, cooldown
         ▼
  DriftAlert + notification    ── if threshold exceeded
```

The entire pipeline is asynchronous — `capture_fact_snapshot.delay(job.id)`
is called from `RunJob.post_run_hook()` after `finish_fact_cache()` completes,
so it does not slow down job completion.

## Models

### HostFactSnapshot

Point-in-time capture of `ansible_facts` for a single host.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `host` | FK → Host | The host whose facts were captured |
| `job` | FK → Job (nullable) | The job that triggered the capture |
| `inventory` | FK → Inventory | Inherited from host |
| `organization` | FK → Organization | Inherited from inventory |
| `captured_at` | DateTime | When the snapshot was taken |
| `facts` | JSON | Full `ansible_facts` dictionary |
| `facts_hash` | CharField(64) | SHA-256 of sorted JSON — for quick equality check |

**Key behavior:** A snapshot is only created when `facts_hash` differs from
the most recent snapshot for the same host. This prevents storing duplicate
snapshots when facts haven't changed.

### DriftDetection

A single detected configuration change between two consecutive snapshots.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `host` | FK → Host | Which host changed |
| `snapshot_before` | FK → HostFactSnapshot | Previous state |
| `snapshot_after` | FK → HostFactSnapshot | New state |
| `job` | FK → Job | Which job caused the change |
| `category` | CharField | packages, services, users_groups, network, mounts, kernel, other |
| `severity` | CharField | low, medium, high, critical |
| `fact_path` | CharField | Top-level fact key (e.g. `ansible_packages`) |
| `summary` | CharField | Human-readable change description |
| `detail` | JSON | `{before, after, diff_type}` |
| `acknowledged` | Boolean | Whether an admin has reviewed this change |
| `acknowledged_by` | FK → User | Who acknowledged |
| `acknowledged_at` | DateTime | When acknowledged |

### Category Classification

| Category | Matched facts | Default severity |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| `packages` | ansible_packages, ansible_pkg_mgr, *package*, *pip* | medium |
| `services` | ansible_services, ansible_service_mgr, *systemd* | medium |
| `users_groups` | ansible_user_*, *user*, *group*, *passwd* | high |
| `network` | ansible_all_ipv4/6_addresses, ansible_interfaces, *tcp*, *port* | high |
| `mounts` | ansible_mounts, ansible_devices, *disk*, *lvm* | medium |
| `kernel` | ansible_kernel*, ansible_sysctl, ansible_selinux | critical |
| `other` | Everything else | low |

**Volatile keys skipped:** `ansible_date_time`, `ansible_uptime_seconds`,
`ansible_local`, `module_setup`, `gather_subset`.

### DriftAlertRule

User-defined rule for alerting when drift exceeds a threshold.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | CharField | Rule name (unique per org) |
| `organization` | FK → Organization | Scope |
| `enabled` | Boolean | Active or paused |
| `inventory` | FK → Inventory (optional) | Filter by inventory |
| `host_filter` | CharField | fnmatch pattern (e.g. `web-*`) |
| `categories` | JSON list | Which drift categories to match (empty = all) |
| `severity_min` | CharField | Minimum severity to count (low/medium/high/critical) |
| `threshold_count` | Integer | How many drift items trigger the alert |
| `threshold_window_minutes` | Integer | Time window for counting |
| `cooldown_minutes` | Integer | Minimum time between alert firings |
| `notification_template` | FK → NotificationTemplate | Where to send alert |

### DriftAlert

Immutable record of a triggered alert.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `alert_rule` | FK → DriftAlertRule | Which rule triggered |
| `host` | FK → Host | Which host caused it |
| `drift_count` | Integer | How many drift items were counted |
| `summary` | Text | Human-readable description |
| `notification_status` | CharField | pending, sent, failed |
| `notification_error` | Text | Error message if send failed |

## Alert Rule — Create Example

```bash
curl -X POST https://forge.example.com/api/v2/drift_alert_rules/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Critical kernel changes",
    "organization": 1,
    "categories": ["kernel", "users_groups"],
    "severity_min": "high",
    "threshold_count": 1,
    "threshold_window_minutes": 60,
    "cooldown_minutes": 30,
    "notification_template": 5
  }'
```

---

## CSV Compliance Export

```bash
# Export all drift for an inventory in the last 30 days
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  "https://forge.example.com/api/v2/drift_detections/export/?inventory=3&date_from=2026-03-01" \
  -o drift_report.csv
```

Output columns: ID, Host, Detected At, Category, Severity, Fact Path,
Summary, Diff Type, Acknowledged.

---

## Snapshot Cleanup

Periodic task `cleanup_old_snapshots` runs as a Celery beat task:

- Default retention: 90 days
- Always keeps at least 2 snapshots per host
- Run manually: `forge-manage shell -c "from forge.main.tasks.drift import cleanup_old_snapshots; cleanup_old_snapshots()"`

---

## Frontend

Four pages under the **Compliance** sidebar section:

| Page | Route | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Drift Detections | `/drift_detections` | Filterable list with category/severity badges, CSV export |
| Drift Detection Detail | `/drift_detections/:id` | Before/after JSON diff, acknowledge button |
| Drift Alert Rules | `/drift_alert_rules` | CRUD list with create/edit/enable/disable |
| Drift Alert Rule Detail | `/drift_alert_rules/:id` | Config summary, recent triggered alerts |
| Drift Alerts | `/drift_alerts` | Read-only list of triggered alerts |
| Drift Alert Detail | `/drift_alerts/:id` | Alert summary, notification status/error |
| Fact Snapshots | `/fact_snapshots` | Browse captured snapshots by host/job |

---

## Security

- **RBAC:** All endpoints require authentication. Non-admin users only see
  drift for hosts in their organization.
- **No write access to drift data:** DriftDetection records are created
  automatically by the system — users can only acknowledge, not modify.
- **Immutable snapshots:** HostFactSnapshot records cannot be updated or
  deleted through the API.
