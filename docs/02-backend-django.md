# 02 — Backend (Django)

Overview of backend modules — what each part does, where to find things, and what to watch out for.

---

## Django Applications

| App | Path | Responsibility |
|-----|------|----------------|
| `forge.main` | `forge/main/` | Core: models, tasks, signals, migrations, commands |
| `forge.api` | `forge/api/` | REST API: views, serializers, URL routing |
| `forge.conf` | `forge/conf/` | Database-backed settings system |
| `forge.sso` | `forge/sso/` | SSO authentication (LDAP, SAML, social) |
| `forge.ui_next` | `forge/ui_next/` | React frontend (served through Django) |

---

## Models — Where things live

All models are in `forge/main/models/`. Each file covers one domain area:

| File | Contents | Note |
|------|----------|------|
| `base.py` | Base classes for all models | `PrimordialModel` adds `created_by`, `modified_by` — every model has these |
| `organization.py` | Organization, Team, Profile | Organization is the top-level container — **everything** belongs to one |
| `unified_jobs.py` | UnifiedJobTemplate, UnifiedJob | Abstract base for ALL job types — key to understanding the system |
| `jobs.py` | JobTemplate, Job, JobHostSummary | Template defines "what to run", Job is "one execution of it" |
| `inventory.py` | Inventory, Host, Group, InventorySource | Host/Group hierarchy, cloud sync sources |
| `projects.py` | Project, ProjectUpdate | Git repository with playbooks |
| `credentials/` | Credential, CredentialType | Encrypted secrets — **never** plaintext in the database |
| `workflow.py` | WorkflowJobTemplate, nodes | DAG orchestration — success/failure/always branches |
| `ha.py` | Instance, InstanceGroup | Cluster nodes and capacity |
| `events.py` | JobEvent (and variants) | Output for every job — **partitioned table** |
| `notifications.py` | NotificationTemplate | Email, Slack, webhook, PagerDuty... |
| `schedules.py` | Schedule | iCal recurrence rules for automatic execution |
| `activity_stream.py` | ActivityStream | Audit log of all changes |
| `mixins.py` | SurveyJobTemplateMixin | Survey system — static and dynamic choices (see `docs/13-dynamic-surveys.md`) |
| `audit.py` | AuditEvent | Immutable security audit log — credential access, auth, permissions (see `docs/14-audit-trail.md`) |
| `eda.py` | EventRule, EventLog, OutboundWebhook | Event-Driven Automation — webhook rules, condition engine, outbound hooks (see `docs/15-event-driven-automation.md`) |
| `drift.py` | HostFactSnapshot, DriftDetection, DriftAlertRule, DriftAlert | Drift Detection — fact snapshots, change tracking, alert rules (see `docs/16-drift-detection.md`) |
| `service_catalog.py` | ServiceCatalogItem, ServiceRequest | Self-Service Portal — curated catalog wrapping JT/WFJT, request lifecycle with optional approval (see `docs/17-self-service-portal.md`) |
| `webauthn.py` | WebAuthnCredential, WebAuthnRegistrationChallenge, WebAuthnAuthenticationChallenge | FIDO2 / WebAuthn — passwordless and second-factor authentication (see `docs/18-oidc-webauthn.md`) |
| `policy.py` | Policy, PolicyDecision | Policy-as-Code (OPA) — Rego rules evaluated before every launch (see `docs/19-policy-as-code.md`) |
| `scanner.py` | Scanner, ScanResult, ScanFinding | IaC scanning & supply chain security — ansible-lint / checkov / pip-audit run before every launch (see `docs/20-iac-scanning.md`). Companion package: `forge/main/scanning/` (runner + tool adapters). |
| `observability/` | (package, no ORM models) | OpenTelemetry bootstrap + helpers + tracing seams + metric handles + collector health probe. Initialized from `forge/asgi.py` / `forge/wsgi.py` / Celery boot. See `docs/21-observability.md`. |
| `tenancy.py` | TenantUsage, TenantQuotaEvent, TenantIsolationEvent | Multi-tenancy v1 — per-tenant quotas, branding, and cross-tenant audit layered on top of Organization. Companion package: `forge/main/tenancy/` (pure helpers, quota gate, provisioning, branding lookup, usage reconciliation, isolation middleware). Quota gate runs **before** Policy-as-Code and IaC Scanning at job launch. See `docs/22-multi-tenancy.md`. |
| `rbac.py` | Role | RBAC system — roles and permissions |
| `oauth.py` | OAuth2Application, Token | API tokens |
| `execution_environments.py` | ExecutionEnvironment | Container image reference for execution |

### Watch out

- **UnifiedJob pattern:** Every executable (JobTemplate, Project, InventorySource) follows
  the same pattern — a template creates an instance. If you understand `UnifiedJobTemplate → UnifiedJob`,
  you understand all job types.

- **Credential encryption:** Fields marked as `secret` in `CredentialType.inputs` are
  encrypted before saving. Never read credentials directly from the database — use the API.

- **Computed fields on Inventory:** `total_hosts`, `hosts_with_active_failures`, etc.
  are updated via signals. If you add a host directly to the database (not through the API),
  these fields won't update until `update_computed_fields()` is called.

- **Organization is required:** Almost every resource requires an `organization` FK. Without
  an organization, RBAC won't work because roles are inherited from the organization.

## REST API — Structure

The API is in `forge/api/` and follows DRF (Django REST Framework) conventions.

### File locations

| What you're looking for | Where to find it |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| API endpoints (URL routing) | `forge/api/urls/` — one file per resource |
| View logic (what the endpoint does) | `forge/api/views/` — one file per resource |
| Serialization (JSON ↔ Model) | `forge/api/serializers/` — data transformation |
| Permissions | `forge/api/permissions.py` — access checks |
| Authentication | `forge/api/authentication.py` — session, token, basic |
| Pagination | `forge/api/pagination.py` — default 25 per page |
| Filtering | `forge/api/filters.py` — search, ordering, field filters |

### API conventions

- **List:** `GET /api/v2/{resource}/` → paginated JSON with `count`, `next`, `previous`, `results`
- **Detail:** `GET /api/v2/{resource}/{id}/` → single object
- **Create:** `POST /api/v2/{resource}/` → body with data
- **Update:** `PATCH /api/v2/{resource}/{id}/` → partial update
- **Delete:** `DELETE /api/v2/{resource}/{id}/` → 204 No Content
- **Actions:** `POST /api/v2/{resource}/{id}/{action}/` → launch, cancel, update...
- **Nested:** `GET /api/v2/{parent}/{id}/{child}/` → related resources

### Watch out

- **`related` field:** Every API response has a `related` dict with URLs to related
  resources. Use this instead of manually constructing URLs.

- **`summary_fields`:** Inline data about related objects (organization name, project name...).
  This eliminates the need for additional API calls.

- **OPTIONS request:** Every endpoint returns metadata about available fields and actions
  via OPTIONS. Useful for dynamically generating forms.

- **RBAC filtering:** List endpoints automatically filter results based on user permissions.
  An admin sees everything; a regular user sees only what they have access to.

## Signals — Automatic side-effect actions

Signals are in `forge/main/signals.py` and automatically react to database changes:

| Signal | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| Post-save on any model | Creates a record in the Activity Stream |
| Host create/delete | Updates computed fields on the Inventory |
| User change (superuser) | Synchronizes the system_administrator role |
| Group deletion | Moves child groups and hosts to the parent |
| Workflow changes | Updates approval template lifecycle |

**Watch out:** Signals execute synchronously — if a signal throws an exception,
the entire transaction is rolled back. If you see unexpected IntegrityError,
check if a signal is attempting something invalid.

---

## Management Commands

Commands are in `forge/main/management/commands/`. They are run with `forge-manage`
(or `awx-manage` — both work, backward compatibility).

### Most important commands

**Instance management:**
- `forge-manage provision_instance --hostname=node1` — register a new cluster node
- `forge-manage deprovision_instance --hostname=node1` — remove a node
- `forge-manage list_instances` — show all nodes with capacity

**Users:**
- `forge-manage createsuperuser` — create admin user
- `forge-manage update_password --username=admin --password=new` — reset password

**Database:**
- `forge-manage migrate` — apply migrations
- `forge-manage check_db` — verify database connectivity
- `forge-manage dbshell` — open PostgreSQL shell

**Cleanup (run periodically):**
- `forge-manage cleanup_jobs --days=90` — delete old jobs and events
- `forge-manage cleanup_sessions` — delete expired sessions
- `forge-manage cleanup_tokens` — delete expired OAuth tokens

**Diagnostics:**
- `forge-manage check_instance_ready` — is the node ready for work
- `forge-manage stats` — system statistics

### Watch out

- `cleanup_jobs` is **critical** for production. Without it, the job event table grows
  without limit. Recommendation: set up as a System Job that runs daily.

- `provision_instance` is automatically called in the init script during deployment.
  You only run it manually when adding new nodes to the cluster.

## Configuration System — Two levels

### Level 1: File-based (Django settings)

Loaded at startup, cannot be changed without restart.

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `forge/settings/defaults/base.py` | Core: DATABASES, INSTALLED_APPS, REST_FRAMEWORK |
| `forge/settings/defaults/auth.py` | Authentication backends |
| `forge/settings/defaults/jobs.py` | Job execution defaults |
| `forge/settings/defaults/celery_conf.py` | Celery/Redis configuration |
| `forge/settings/defaults/logging_conf.py` | Logging |
| `forge/settings/production.py` | Production overrides (DEBUG=False) |
| `/etc/tower/conf.d/*.py` | Per-module settings inside the container |

### Level 2: Database-backed (Forge conf system)

Stored in PostgreSQL, changed via API (`/api/v2/settings/`) **without restart**.

Registered in `forge/conf/` and covering: job timeouts, LDAP configuration,
logging, notifications, and much more.

**Watch out:** Database settings **override** file settings. If something isn't
working as expected, check if it's been overridden in the database:

```bash
forge-manage print_setting SETTING_NAME
```

---

## Migrations

Forge has **252 Django migrations** in `forge/main/migrations/`.

### Watch out

- All migrations reference `forge.main.fields` — not `awx.main.fields`. If you
  create a new migration, `makemigrations` will automatically use the correct prefix.

- **Never edit existing migrations** — only add new ones.

- If a migration fails, check `forge-manage showmigrations | grep "\[ \]"`
  to see which ones are unapplied.

- The init script automatically runs `migrate` during deployment.
