# Changelog

All notable changes to the Forge Backend will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project adheres to CalVer (`YYYY.MM.PATCH`).

## [Unreleased]

## [2026.05.0] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed
- `DriftAlertRule` rows could not be cascade-deleted from an
  Organization: the original `0198_drift_models` migration omitted
  the `created_by` / `modified_by` FK columns inherited from
  `PrimordialModel`, so any ORM query that joined the audit columns
  blew up with `psycopg.UndefinedColumn`. Symptom in the wild was
  `DELETE /api/v2/organizations/{id}/` returning HTTP 500 and the
  forge-operator finalizer hanging. Migration `0208` backfills both
  columns nullable + SET_NULL; a schema-level regression test in
  `tests_standalone/test_drift_audit_fields_schema.py` keeps the
  same gap from re-opening.

## [2026.04.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- Multi-Tenancy v2: per-tenant Celery queue routing and per-tenant
  API rate limiting (token bucket via Redis)
- Recommendations engine with 12 rules and REST API
- Standalone tests separated from the AWX-inherited test suite
- Podman installed in the runtime image for EE container isolation
- `23-recommendations` API reference doc
- Assistant API surface for the Ollama+RAG chat sidecar

### Changed
- Renamed all `awx-*` references to `forge-*` in user-facing strings,
  CLI commands (`forge-manage`), Django app labels, and docs
- Cleaned up legacy AWX docs and updated README links

### Fixed
- psycopg 3.2 API break in `PubSub.current_notifies`
- Migration ordering for fresh installs against existing AWX databases
